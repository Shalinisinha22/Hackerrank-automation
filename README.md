Hello everyone,
Project Name: HackerRank Automation 
This is my first project using puppeteer library of NodeJs.

This Code runs in such a way that it will first open the Chromium Browser then automatically login in the 𝐇𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐖𝐞𝐛𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞
After that : 
1)Auto login
2)Select the topic (Automatically)
3)Choose the question
4)Start Solving Question & submit the code.
